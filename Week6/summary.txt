hypercube of dim n: 
Conditions (2) and (3): C_2^dim
Condition (1) does nothing.
hypercube of dim n with one corner cut off:
Dim 2,4,5,6,7:
Conditions (2) and (3): Trivial group
Condition (1) obviously does nothing
Dim 3:
Conditions (2) and (3): S_3
Condition (1) does nothing

hypercube of dim n with two opposite corners cut off:
Conditions (2) and (3): Trivial group
Condition (1) obviously does nothing
CP_n:
Conditions (2) and (3): S_{n+1}
Condition (1) does nothing.
CP_n with one corner cut off:
Conditions (2) and (3): S_{n}
Condition (1): S_{n-1}, because (-1,-1,...-1) has different length than other faces, hence can't be in image of an automorphism(does this make sense)?
